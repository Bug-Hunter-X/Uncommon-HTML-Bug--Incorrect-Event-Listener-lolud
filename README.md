This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to event listeners. Specifically, it showcases the use of `attachEvent`, a method that is now considered outdated and may lead to unexpected behavior in modern browsers. The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version using the standard `addEventListener` method.  This is important because `attachEvent` was primarily used in older Internet Explorer versions and doesn't conform to the standards of W3C event handling. Using `addEventListener` ensures broader compatibility and better interoperability.
